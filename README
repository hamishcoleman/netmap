Using simple tools like traceroute, build a network
map in a machine readable graphviz layout.

This can be used to find changes in the network, or
just for documentation purposes.

Configure
---------

Create a text file with the list of network destinations.  Use hash symbols
to start comments.  Any destination can also have a text description - added
after a space - which will be shown in the final output.

Multiple different source files might exist, for probing different sets of
destinations, or for running probes from different sources

Run
---

Usage:

    .../tracemtr $DESTINATIONSFILE

It will probe the route to each destination in the file and cache the raw
results in a subdirectory called traces.

Once all the results are collected, a graphvis file will be created showing
the paths that were observed.

TODO
----

- make multiple probe sources work better
- glom runs of unknown hops together
- name unknown hops in such a way to increase the chances that other runs will
  share the same unknown hop when it makes sense to do so
- some of these improvements might suggest a rewrite to not use bash
- improve the storage format so that it is more suitable for storing the output
  in a version control system
